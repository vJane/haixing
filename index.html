          <h3>1. Women are underrepresented in academia.</h3>
          <h5>Among faculty at all US universities in 2015, 49.1% of faculty at US universities were female, a percentage that
            has rapidly grown from 33.2% in 1987. It is important to remember, however, that women are overrepresented in
            lower-ranking academic positions.</h5>
          <h5>While women represent over half (51.5%) of Assistant Professors and are near parity (44.9%) among Associate Professors,
            they accounted for less than a third (32.4%) of Professors in 2015.</h5>
          <h3>2. Men outearn women at all faculty levels.</h3>
          <h5>At all categories of institutions, full professors who are women earned on average $98,524 a year compared to $104,493
            for their male colleagues in 2016–2017. That’s 94.3% of what men earned.</h5>

            institution

          <ul>
            <li>
              <h6>Our visualizations are based on publicly available data and information; any and all potential errors reflect
                those of these online resources.</h6>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h6>We would like to take special note to address that the gender-binary nature of this project is based merely
                on the data/information we were able to find in the time we had provided to work on this project. The lack
                of data concerning nonbinary gender identities is a serious issue that reflects the gravity of the problem.
                Due to the lack of data on this and due to our focus on women, however, this was not given the attention
                needed.
              </h6>
