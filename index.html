            <span>Note: </span>We would like to take special note to address that the gender-binary nature of this project is based
            merely on the data/information we were able to find in the time we had provided to work on this project. The
            lack of data concerning nonbinary gender identities is a serious issue that reflects the gravity of the problem.
            Due to the lack of data on this and due to our focus on women, however, this was not given the attention needed.
